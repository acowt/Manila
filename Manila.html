<a name="Quiapo"  class="places"> 1. Quiapo Church </a><br><br>
<img src="manila(3).png" class="pics"> <br><br>
<p class="para"> The Quiapo Church is one of the oldest and most admired Catholic Churches in Manila. The more formal name of the church is the Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene. Depending on the time of day, the plaza surrounding the century-old church can be quite congested, which makes it an interesting place to visit to admire the devotion of the Filipino people. Fridays are the busiest days, when thousands of people pile into the square and pray at the church for novena. Despite the large gatherings of church devotees, this is one of the top attractions in the city. Take time to see the inside of the church, and stroll through the market stands outside to buy fresh peanuts, mangoes, or necklaces from local vendors.</p>

<a name="Ocean" class="places"> 2. Manila Ocean Park</a><br><br>
<img src="manila(4).png" class="pics"> <br><br>
<p style="margin:200px; margin-top:0px">The Manila Ocean Park is one of the most unique adventures in the city. Get interactive with marine life with the Sharks and Rays Encounter, Trails to Antarctica, or the fish spa where fish clean your feet in a small pool of water. The park easily fills several hours depending on how many encounters you try. In addition to the state-of-the-art aquatic facility, you will see exhibits of birds and other animals. If you plan to make several days out of it, you can stay on-site at the Hotel H20 and admire the large fish tanks in your room.</p>
<br><br><br>

<a name="Museum" class="places"> 3. National Museum of the Philippines</a><br><br>
<img src="manila(5).png"> <br><br>
<p style="margin:200px; margin-top:0px">For a true exploration into the culture of the country, a visit to the National Museum of the Philippines is in order. The museum has four main complexes and extensive collections and artifacts relating to art, archaeology, anthropology, zoology, biology, and natural history. The museum galleries help offer a sense of place, telling the cultural story beyond what you will find on your own visiting the city's many historical attractions.</p>

<a name="Santiago" class="places"> 4. Fort Santiago</a><br><br>
<img src="manila(6).png" class="pics"> <br><br>
<p style="margin:200px; margin-top:0px">The site of Fort Santiago is an impressive stop if you are visiting the city and it is one of the most important historical sites in Manila. The 16th-century fortress was key in protecting the Intramuros, which is the oldest district in Manila, known historically as the Walled City. You can explore the grounds at a leisurely pace. Be sure to take note of bullet markings that are still visible in the fortress walls and stop by the visitor center for more detailed information about the fort.</p>

<img src="manila(7).png" class="pics"> <br><br>
<p style="margin:200px; margin-top:0px">If you are in the mood to bargain shop, head to the lively Divisoria Market in Manila. It is located in the heart of Chinatown where you will discover overflowing vendor stalls selling everything from fruit and spices to flip-flops and beads. This is the best place to people-watch and take in the local flavor. The bustling atmosphere is like a flea market, and bargaining is the name of the game. You should only pay about 50-percent of the price of an item, and often you can get souvenirs for much lower.</p>

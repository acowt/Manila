The highly urbanized district of Bonifacio Global City has experienced commercial growth through the sale of military land 
by the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA). This entire district was used to be the part of the main Philippine 
Army camp in Metro Manila, Fort Andres Bonifacio.

Bonifacio Global City is now home to upscale residential condominiums such as Essensa, Serendra, Pacific Plaza Towers, One 
McKinley Place, Bonifacio Ridge, and Regent Parkway and office buildings such as Net One and Bonifacio Technology Center. 
Most trendy restaurants, bars, clubs, and retail outlets are located in Bonifacio High Street, Serendra, The Fort Square and 
Fort Strip. Meanwhile, Bonifacio Stop-over and the Car Plaza cater to motorists. Global City is anchored by a major shopping 
center, Ayala Land's Market! Market! and by 2013, SM Aura.

Many corporations have acquired properties and some have committed to relocate their regional or national headquarters, among 
them are Accenture, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Deutsche Bank, Lawson Software, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, 
Ericsson, TetraPak, JPMorgan Chase and Safeway.  </pre></p></center>

Venice Grand Canal is a lifestyle mall development under Megaworld Lifestyle Malls located inside the 50-hectare McKinley Hill 
township of Megaworld Corporation in Fort Bonifacio Taguig City.

Awarded the Best Retail Architectural Design at the Philippine Property Awards in 2017, Venice Grand Canal is known for its 
design and architecture and is popularly considered as the "most romantic mall" in the country.

Living up to its namesake, the mall sports an Italian-inspired architectural design inspired by the Grand Canal in the classical 
city of Venice, Italy. In designing the mall, Megaworld consulted the Rome-based architectural firm Paolo Marioni Architetto to 
ensure that the Venice Grand Canal Mall stays true to its Venetian inspiration.

Highlighting the mall is the man-made Grand Canal. The mall's grand canal offers mall guests an Italian experience with  gondola 
ride tours by singing gondoliers.

The mall also has replicas of St. Mark's Campanile in Piazza San Marco, the Rialto Bridge, which is inspired by the famous bridge 
in Venice and the Ponte de Amore bridge, where mall guests can participate at the mall's love locks installation. </pre></p></center>

Since they opened Mercado Del Lago to the public as their newest attraction last May 2018, I have been noticing photos of this 
place all over social media particularly here on wordpress. I was not impressed at first because it’s something that is not 
already new to me but yesterday, I was searching for a place to visit and even asked some of my friends if what are the newest 
attractions all over Manila then Mercado Del Lago is on their number one list so I decided to try as I was intrigued.

Well, it is basically a food park that sits on the water- literally translated as market by the lake. It even have a stilt houses 
which I think to complete the “by the lake” dining experience. I was reading comments on facebook and some were saying that this 
is a resort and something like a “high class restaurant” but mind you, it is not. Again, it is just a food park with a fantastic 
view of the lake. </pre></p></center>

Located in Fort Bonifacio, the Libingan ng mga Bayani is the memorial ground of 33,520 Filipino soldiers who were killed in Corregidor, 
Bataan, and in other battlefields during World War II. It lies side by side with the American War Memorial.

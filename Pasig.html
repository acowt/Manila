The original zoo is farther East in Montalban, Rizal, but this 2,000-square-meter urban safari is just as delightful. 
Barely six months since it opened, Ark Avilon is already drawing hordes of kids and adults alike, eager to see a giant 
tortoise, a tiger, a lion and a jaguar up close. There are also less aggressive animals that kids can still have tons 
of fun watching, such as a python, an orangutan and the ever friendly and playful rabbits

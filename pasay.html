The Philippine's most aggressive real estate arm had promised one time of making Pasay City 
into Philippines' "most modern business, residential and recreational district." Indeed, 
Pasay has the 4th largest shopping mall in the Philippines and the 11th in the world. Mall 
of Asia consists of four buildings linked by walkways: the Main Mall, the Entertainment Mall 
and the North and South Parking Buildings.

The mall houses the first Olympic-sized skating rink and is known to have the biggest of its kind 
in Southeast Asia. A recreational and competitive figure skating could be accommodated in this area. 
This scope features a digital planetarium and a wide range of technology and science-themed exhibits. 
The museum also features 118 new interactive exhibits and over 100 non-interactive exhibits in eight 
major interactive galleries namely the Natural World, Human Adventure, Zoom, Connect, Cyberville, Space 
Camp, the Living Earth and Science Park. A galleon ship is also a must-see for the history lovers and you 
can catch it at The Gale√≥n museum. And the Mall of Asia is a great place to indulge in whatever type of 
cuisine for a quick sumptuous treat, with a number of bistros, cafes, and brasseries. </pre></p></center>

The Dessert Museum isn't really a museum but a pastel-hued attraction dedicated to candy and sweets. Located in swanky 
S Maison Mall at the base of Conrad Hotel Manila, it opened its doors on 10 February 2018 and boasts eight themed rooms, 
each inspired by a different confection like donuts, marshmallows, and gummy bears. For PHP 799 (PHP 699 if you purchase 
tickets online), tour-goers get a two-hour curated tour of the museum along with up to 6 free desserts.

It's a novel and fun concept driven not just by a passion for sweets, but by the popularity of social media platforms like 
Instagram. As promised on their website, not only will you be treated to free desserts, but you'll also get the "most likes 
you've ever had on your Instagram photo." For the sweetest pictures, be sure to come in your cutest #ootd. </pre></p></center>

It is quite rare for one to see weapons, armors and things that are used for defense in public. But a chance to have a 
clear visual of this military paraphernalia and the like is an opportunity you will surely miss should you fail to visit 
the Philippine Airforce Aerospace Museum. This military museum was founded as Marcos Museum on May 2, 1974, a science and 
technology museum established to honor heroes and airmen of the Philippine Airforce.

There are five areas that you can explore within this facility. The Heritage Section displays various galleries reminiscent 
of weapons, uniforms, dioramas, miniatures, memorabilia, photos and arts of early military aviation and the Philippine Air 
Force organization. The Science and Technology Section showcases aircraft mock-ups and miniatures, indoor static aircraft of 
various eras as well as some PAF experimental projects presented in ways to inspire the young generation of Filipinos to learn 
on aerospace-related sciences.

The Museum's Art Corner shows skillful drawings and paintings that portray PAF history and its various roles to the Filipino 
nation. The themed Aircraft Park displays historic PAF aircraft as well as a venue for photography activities. The Function Room 
can accommodate 150 to 200 people for seminars, workshops, symposia, expositions and cultural activities in service to the community 
and common social events. And the Mini Theater is a 45-seater cinema which is ideal for small group film showings, seminars, workshops, 
expositions and symposia.  </pre></p></center>

DreamPlay is a world-class and revolutionary approach to family entertainment. Play, dance, laugh, and party with all your favorite 
DreamWorks friends! Test your skills, seek adventure, and have the time of your life as you explore our wondrous and spectacular attractions 
inside DreamPlay!  

I like that the attractions stimulate the minds of the kids and challenge their creativity. The activities are interactive, like workshop 
classes and exercise activities for your little ones. 

Although, some say the entrance fee isn't worth it, considering how relatively small the place is, with limited 
attractions you can finish in two hours. Others comment that it's just an interactive day care where parents, who want to spend more time 
in the casino, can drop off their kids. </pre></p></center>

The fastest way to get to Makati is by MRT train. If you disembark at Ayala Station, you can walk to Glorietta and Greenbelt. 
Other stations include Guadalupe, Buendia, and Magallenes. There are also buses coming from EDSA that will bring you to the city.

Nuestra Señora de Gracia Church in Guadalupe was built in 1630, and despite being centuries-old, it still continues to captivate 
visitors. It's also a popular venue for weddings. What makes the church marvelous is its combination of different architectural 
styles. The main entrance with Doric columns is influenced by the Renaissance period while the leaf carvings are Baroque-inspired. 
Inside, the Baroque influence can also be seen on the windows while the floor plan is Romanesque. It may look huge on the outside, 
but once you go in, you will be astounded with its intimate appearance. </pre></p></center>
